# Intro-To-AI

## Pre-requisite : numpy and matplotlib libraries

### Note : It will ask user for input but I have taken care of that by explaining in the terminal of writing format
#### For e.g. :
####            1 2 3
####            4 5 6
####            7 8 0
#### Just like that in 3 rows and columns for every python code. Also, when it will ask for first time, I want the user to input the values given in assignment paper to see the difference himself. And then after that it will ask for 10 instances with initial state and goal state. And will give a plot of time at the end of code.
